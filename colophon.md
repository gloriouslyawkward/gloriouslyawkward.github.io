## What's is this page?

A colophon is definied as a brief description of publication or production notes relevant to the edition, in modern books usually located at the verso of the title-leaf, but also sometimes located at the end of the book.  I first saw this used by [John Saddington](https://twitter.com/8bit/) when he had a web site of his own (he now redirects `john.do` to his Twitter/X account), wherein he provided a listing of the products he uses in his day-to-day life in addition to how his web site was put together. 

You can find a short listing of other users' colophons at <https://indieweb.org/colophon>.

## So this is mine.

This site uses the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.org) engine and is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). Pages can be written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) or HTML with [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) markup, and Jekyll takes care of the rest. The site template is called Minima and is standard with Github Pages. 

I originally chose [Cormorant](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Cormorant) as my site's font, which is what I use for everything else, but it renders thin and proved uneasy on the eyes when on a screen, so I switched to the [EB Garamond](https://fonts.google.com/?query=EB+Garamond) family, which is close in style while being easier to read. Both families are available via Google Fonts. Monospaced type is rendered in [Fira Mono](https://fonts.google.com?query=Fira+Mono). [Disqus](https://disqus.com) is used as the post comment manager.

## My daily hardware.

I switched back to Windows from MacOS back in 2022 after Apple switched their machines to run on their own in-house Apple Silicon&mdash;not because Intel was superior but because the use of integrated memory means upgrading a Mac's RAM requires buying a whole new machine. Given the choice I would prefer to use Linux, but some of my software and games run poorly, if at all, under [WINE](https://www.wine-hq.org).  I may eventually go back to a Mac if the pricing is right.  _(EDIT: I'm on a Mac mini again, and I blame Taylor.)_

My personal laptop is a Victus by HP 15&Prime; Gaming Laptop running on an Intel Core i7-12650H CPU and Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti Notebook GPU. I've upgraded it since purchase to 64 GB of [G.Skill](https://www.gskill.com) RAM and a 2 TB Samsung EVO 900 m.2 SSD. 

My work laptop is an HP ZBook Firefly 15&Prime; G8 provided by my employer.

For document scanning (because I try to go as paperless as possible), I use a Brother DSMobile 720DW wireless portable page scanner and use `ocrmypdf` on the command line to OCR and otherwise process scans. I have an HP OfficeJet Pro 9015e on my desktop that does the same thing. 

## Mobile hardware.

When out and about I can always be found with my Samsung Galaxy Z Fold4 smartphone and Fold Edition S Pen, and often also with my Samsung Galaxy Tab S8+ 5G. I almost dare to say that the Galaxy Tab could replace my laptop for most of the things I do, especially since it has a 1 TB microSD Card installed for storage. I have Termux installed on both devices so I have access to a usable Linux environment on all of my devices (in addition to Windows Services for Linux on the laptops).

## Software tools.

- [Quicken Classic Premier](https://quicken.com) for my finances, after using other console-based tools like `ledger`, `hledger`, `beancount`, and even `.org` files.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.com/code) and ol' fashioned [Emacs](https://emacs.gnu.org) for text editing.
- Chrome and Microsoft Edge for web browsing (the latter is required for work).
- [Gmail](https://gmail.com) for email (combining both Google and Outlook accounts in one place).
- I pay for both Google One and Microsoft 365, although I am leaning more these days toward the Microsoft product and less on Google. _If only Microsoft hadn't abandoned Windows Phone; I'd still be using it._
