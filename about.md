# Hi, I'm Steven.

<img float="right" src="/images/portrait300x300.jpg">

&hellip;and I'm celebrating recovery from pornography addiction and living with Asperger Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and Arrested Development Disorder. 

There, now that we got that out of the way&hellip;

I&hellip;

- was born and raised in Santa Ana, California.

- was the continuous target of school bullies from second grade through high school (thus the Arrested Development Disorder&mdash;I'm a twelve-year-old trapped in the body of a fifty-something).

- grew up Catholic desiring to become a priest when I grew up, until my family left the Catholic Church in 1985. 

- became a "born-again" Christian at a Billy Graham crusade in July, 1985 (and probably rededicated at nearly every winter and summer church camp after that during my youth).

- felt a call to ministry while in junior college and serving as a worship musician in the church I became a Christian in, and transferred to [Vanguard Unversity of Southern California](https://www.vanguard.edu) (then Southern California College) in 1993, and earned a Bachelor of Arts _cum laude_ in religion with emphasis in pastoral ministry in 1996 while serving as a worship musician and team spiritual director at another church.

- lost my grandfather in 1994, and my mother in 1996, both to cancer.

- moved out on my own into a 450-square-foot studio apartment in California in 1996.

- married, almost sight unseen, in 1998 after "dating" and "courting" via AOL Instant Messenger.

- left everything behind and moved from California to Lakeland, Florida, in 2000.

- bought our first house in 2002.

- adopted our only child, a son, from family friends in 2003. 

- got caught with online pornography and started with [Celebrate Recovery](https://celebraterecovery.com) in 2005. Went on to become a recovery teacher and small-group leader and continue to celebrate my recovery. Was also here where I was diagnosed with mental illness and began therapy.

- was laid off in 2007.

- received divorce papers in 2008, moved to Plant City, Florida.

- filed for bankruptcy in 2009&ndash;2010 and was almost homeless twice.

- married my jr. high crush in the Catholic Church in 2013 after a lengthy canonical annulment and counseling process.

- moved to Tampa in 2013.

- very suddenly became a widower in 2016 when the love of my life literally and inexplicably dropped dead in our apartment.

- evacuated from Hurricane Irma in 2017.

- moved back to Plant City in 2019 to start over and returned to the Catholic church for a while to regain a sense of spiritual discipline.

- found a new church home and the change to pick up where I left off when I moved from California, and am moving to Clermont, Florida, in 2023.
